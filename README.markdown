# ColorBar

ColorBar is a demo application that I tossed together one evening to mess around with getting dynamic colors from arbitrary data.  The actual project and source isn't actually useful, but it allowed me to play around with and try out a few basic concepts: the suitability of a sha1 hash as a color source, text color changes based on brightness, and simple IBInspectable interactions.  The basic ideas present would be better implemented in the Cocoa world as a value transformer.

This project is provided without any kind of warranty or promise.  I'm submitting the code to the public domain in case anyone finds some or all of it useful.  I won't provide support and I assume no responsibility for its use.

## Demo

Here is a short, looping gif animation of the application in action:
